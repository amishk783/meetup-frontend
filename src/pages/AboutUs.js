          Meetup App is a platform that allows users to create, find, and join
          groups unified by a common passion or goal. We believe in the power of
          bringing people together and we aim to foster a community where
          individuals can share their interests, ideas, and enthusiasm with
          others.

          Founded in 2024, our mission is to help people grow personally and
